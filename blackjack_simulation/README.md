# Blackjack Simulation Project

## Description
This Python project simulates a simplified version of the classic Blackjack card game. The program models a single round between a player and a dealer, applying basic rules for hitting and standing. It demonstrates conditional logic, score calculation, and decision-making in Python.

## Features
- **Player & Dealer Logic:** Automatically decides whether the player or dealer should hit or stay based on predefined thresholds.  
- **Score Calculation:** Adds card values and checks for busts (over 21).  
- **Win Determination:** Determines the winner based on standard Blackjack rules.  
- **Autograder Compatible:** Produces a Boolean output `answer` indicating if the player wins.

# Output Meanings
- `True` indicates the player wins the round  
- `False` indicates the player loses the round

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Core Python libraries (no external dependencies)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ananyaanand7/blackjack_simulation.git

2. Run the program:
python blackjack.py

The console prints whether the player wins the round.
